# **Adam Bouzgan**
## My Porfolio
‚Ä¢ üåç I'm based in the London Area.

‚Ä¢ ‚úâÔ∏è  You can contact me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-bouzgan-293301346/) profile.

‚Ä¢ üß†  I‚Äôm learning Data Analysis skills, including SQL, Python, Tableau, Power BI and Excel.

* With a strong academic background in Mathematics from King‚Äôs College London and experience in data analysis, problem-solving, and business operations, I am eager to contribute my skills to your team.
* Studying Mathematics has sharpened my analytical and critical-thinking abilities. Many of my university modules involved group projects, which enhanced my teamwork and communication skills, as I regularly collaborated with peers to tackle complex problems. These experiences have equipped me with the ability to interpret data, derive insights, and present findings effectively.
* Beyond my academic studies, I have gained valuable real-world experience through running an independent business reselling luxury goods and services. Managing high sales volumes‚Äîup to 40‚Äì50 transactions per day‚Äîrequired me to liaise with manufacturers, oversee logistics, and ensure efficient product distribution. 
Additionally, I completed a virtual investment banking internship, where I developed skills in company valuation, financial modelling, and data analysis. I conducted a comparative analysis of firms in the beer and spirits industry, building a discounted cash flow (DCF) model in Excel to assess potential mergers and acquisitions. Based on my analysis, I successfully recommended a strategic acquisition that demonstrated a strong potential for revenue growth and market expansion. This experience reinforced my proficiency in Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint and deepened my ability to analyse complex datasets to support business decisions.
I am particularly drawn to this opportunity because it aligns with my analytical mindset, problem-solving abilities, and passion for working with data. Given my experience in data interpretation, financial modelling, and business operations, I believe I am well-suited for this role. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills can contribute to your team and look forward to hearing from you soon.
Your Sincerely,
Adam Bouzgan
